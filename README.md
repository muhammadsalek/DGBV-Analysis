# DGBV-Analysis
Statistical analysis of Digital Gender-Based Violence (DGBV) in Bangladesh using R. The study explores demographic factors, online harassment patterns, and public perceptions toward social media’s role in gender-based violence.
This project investigates Digital Gender-Based Violence (DGBV) in Bangladesh using survey data from 250 respondents. It includes a detailed demographic summary covering gender, age groups, and educational qualifications. The analysis examines DGBV experience frequencies, perceptions of social media's role in online violence through Likert-scale measures, and associations between gender and DGBV as well as urban versus rural residence. Statistical tests like Fisher's exact test and Cramér's V are applied to evaluate relationships, while sample size estimation is calculated using the Cochran formula. The project leverages R packages including tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, flextable, gtsummary, and vcd for data cleaning, visualization, and reporting.
